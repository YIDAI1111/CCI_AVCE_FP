# CCI_S3_Advanced Visualisation and Computational Environments_Final

**KiKi and WaWa**

**Brief**: Kiki and Wawa are travelers in the world. They explore the world and meet different friends. This is a simple scenario in the game. Players need to control Kiki to find friends: Dogknight, in order to learn new skills. Players can move freely in the world and can also interact with different objects.


**The style of our environment :**

Low poly art uses the minimal amount of polygons possible to define the shape of an object.  We then apply normal maps, occlusion maps, textures, lighting tricks etc to make the object seem like it has a lot of detail.



**The story of our environment :**

It‘s a hide-and-seek game. Two characters ' Kiki '  and  ' Wawa ' are good friends. When they find each other, the game ends.
