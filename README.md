**KiKi and WaWa**


**The style of our environment :**

Low poly art uses the minimal amount of polygons possible to define the shape of an object.  We then apply normal maps, occlusion maps, textures, lighting tricks etc to make the object seem like it has a lot of detail.



**The story of our environment :**

It‘s a hide-and-seek game. Two characters ' Kiki '  and  ' Wawa ' are good friends. When they find each other, the game ends.



**Guideline for player :**

Different areas can increase the richness of the scene.
